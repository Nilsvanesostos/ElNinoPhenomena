# El Niño Phenomena
Project for the subject Business Economic and Financial Data on the impact of El Niño/La Niña phenomena in the economies of the countries from the West Coast of 
South and Central America. The subject corresponds to the 3rd Semester for the BDMA Master in the Università degli Studi di Padova (UniPd).

## About the data
Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) is a long-term Climate Data Record that incorporates observations from different platforms (satellites, ships, 
buoys, and Argo floats) into a regular global grid. OISST data is originally produced at daily and 1/4° spatial resolution. To avoid the large amount of data processing 
of daily data, we use the monthly aggregated OISST SST data provided by [NOAA Physical Systems Laboratory](https://psl.noaa.gov). The data corresponds to the monthly 
sea surface temperature data and can be downloaded from the following [link](https://osf.io/6pgc2/download/). The dowload may take 2-3 minutes.
